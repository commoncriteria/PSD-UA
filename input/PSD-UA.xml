  <sec:Introduction>
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
      The scope of this PP‐Module is to describe the security functionality of a specific type of Peripheral Sharing
      Device (PSD) product in terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such
      products. A TOE that claims conformance to this PP‐Module must also claim conformance to the
      Peripheral Sharing Device Protection Profile (PSD PP), Version 4.0. This is because the PSD PP is a generic
      Protection Profile aimed at defining baseline requirements and assurance activities for a wide variety of
      PSD products but more specific requirements and assurance activities apply depending on the types of
      physical and logical interfaces provided by a PSD. Therefore, additional Security Functional Requirements
      (SFRs) have been defined in this PP‐Module to define security functionality that is unique to a PSD that
      provides the ability to support user authentication devices.

    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription">
      Any Target of Evaluation (TOE) that conforms to the PSD PP and includes user authentication device
      functionality is considered to be a candidate TOE for claiming conformance to this PP‐Module. In 
      particular, a compliant TOE is expected to support one or more user authentication devices for one or
      more connected computers.<h:br/><h:br/>
      A compliant TOE will have a USB protocol connection for the TOE computer interface and can implement
      the TOE peripheral connection in the following ways:<h:ul>
        <h:li>External ‐ The TOE supports an external user authentication device with an exposed USB interface,
      and whose functionality may be separated from the PSD.</h:li>
        <h:li>Internal ‐ The TOE implements an internal user authentication device whose functionality may
      not be separated from the PSD.</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      A compliant TOE will not emulate the user authentication device or support simultaneous user
      authentication sessions across multiple computers.<h:br/><h:br/>
      All of the requirements and restrictions that are defined in the PSD PP apply to a conformant TOE. A
      compliant TOE will also satisfy all of the specific data protection/isolation capabilities that are required by
      this PP‐Module. A compliant TOE will embody one or more of the use cases defined in the PSD PP. It may
      also provide PSD functionality for additional types of computer interfaces (e.g. keyboard/mouse). In this
      case, the TOE will claim conformance to all applicable PP‐Modules.
    </section>      
      <section title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The TOE boundary is the same as that which is defined for a Peripheral Sharing Device in general. Refer to
        the PSD PP for an outline of the TOE boundary. A TOE that claims conformance to this PP‐Module is not
        prevented from claiming conformance to other PSD PP‐Modules; all relevant PP‐Modules should be
        claimed by the TOE based on the specific types of functionality that it provides.
      </section>      
    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
      No additional use cases are defined for this PP‐Module. The TOE is expected to embody one or more use
      cases as defined by the PSD PP. The functionality defined by this PP‐Module is implementationindependent
      (i.e. not tied to any specific use cases) and is related entirely to the specific security
      requirements related to security of the physical and logical interfaces for user authentication devices.

                  For tests that use the USB sniffer or USB analyzer software, the evaluator verifies whether traffic is sent
                  or not sent by inspection of the passing USB transactions and ensuring they do not contain USB data
                  payloads other than any expected traffic, as well as USB NAK transactions or system messages. To avoid
